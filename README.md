I have created this salary prediction ML app. 
using FastAPI and streamlit

stesps to run

**python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload
**
while keeping the uvicorn server running in the original terminal.

Open a new terminal window (or a new tab if you're using a terminal that supports tabs).
In the new terminal, run the Streamlit app:

**streamlit run your_streamlit_app.py**
